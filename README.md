# labbe-material-icons

### a simple `svg` icon theme in various colours

These icons are all hand crafted, no image editors involved so they are
extremely light weight.

## Build

`make`

There is no install routine, jst copy all of the `labbe-material-*`
directories to `~/local/share/icons/` and start using them.

`make clean` removes all the compiled icons so you can start fresh.

`make && make package` makes a tarball of the icons in the proper
directory structure.
