# labbe-material-icons

### a simple `svg` icon theme in various colours

These icons are all hand crafted, no image editors involved so they are
extremely light weight.

## Build

`make`

Optionally as root:

`make install`

Or, just copy all of the `labbe-material-*` directories to 
`~/.local/share/icons/` and start using them.

`make clean` removes all the compiled icons so you can start fresh.

## Config

The default is to only build `bark` and `sage` colors but you can build
all colors by editing `build.conf` or only one color if you like.

## Bugs

Report them here including feature requests in the `issues` section.
Offer up a pull request if you can fix a bug or add more icons.
